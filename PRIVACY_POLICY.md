# Privacy Policy for BIF Mobile Locator

**Last updated:** February 1, 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how the BIF Mobile Locator team ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "Service").

By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. Location Data

Our application is designed to provide location-based services. We may request access to your device's location (GPS and network-based).

- **How we use it**: To calculate distances between your current position and selected points of interest, and to display your position on the map.
- **Storage**: Location data is processed **locally** on your device within the application's secure storage. We do **not** transmit your precise location history to our servers.
- **Background Usage**: We do **not** collect or access your location while the app is in the background. Location services are only active when you are using the app.

### B. Usage Data & Analytics

We use third-party services to monitor and analyze the use of our Service.

- **Firebase Analytics (Google)**: We use Firebase to understand how users interact with our app (e.g., screens visited, session duration). This service collects:
  - Device identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID).
  - IP address (anonymized).
  - Operating system version.
  - Crash reports (via Firebase Crashlytics if enabled).

For more information, please visit [Google Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## 2. Permissions

To function correctly, the app may request the following permissions:

- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` / `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`: To provide location features.
- `INTERNET`: To connect to analytic services and map providers.

## 3. Data Retention

We do not store your personal data on our servers. All functional data (like location history) remains on your device or is transient (erased after the session). Analytics data is retained by Google according to their policies.

## 4. Security

We value your trust in providing us your information and strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable.

## 5. Children's Privacy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
